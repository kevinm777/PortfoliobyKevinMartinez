    <h1>Outline For Google Remake</h1>
    <h5>by Kevin Martinez</h5>
    <div class="steps">
    <ol>
      <li>First</li>
      <p>Finding the <strong>exact image from the google homepage in 1999</strong> and creating a png by removing the white background from it. This is essential to make it look like the real thing since in 1999 the html was way more simple for the homepage of google.</p>
      <li>Second</li>
      <p>The positioning of the Logo, Label, SearchBar, and Copyright are all centered and have different margin of spacing so you need to note you will use Css to position everything exactly in the middle. We will use the <strong>style tag</strong> for this.</p>
      <li>Third</li>
      <p>Note that <strong>Buttons, Input Boxes, and a working relink to another page</strong> will be used. The highlighted <strong>More Google!</strong> for the project wil link the outline to the Google Home Page Remake just for extra detal.</p>
      <li>Fourth</li>
      <p>It will be easier to start from <strong>top to bottom</strong> meaning you will have to position, resize, and add elements one by one. (Google Image then Input Box, then buttons , and the relink and copyright last.</p>
    </ol>
